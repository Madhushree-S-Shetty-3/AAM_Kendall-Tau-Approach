# AAM_Kendall-Tau-Approach
This project implements a program to calculate Kendall's Tau Rank Correlation Coefficient, a measure of similarity between two rankings, using a movie-ranking scenario. The program compares rankings provided by two individuals, computes similarity and dissimilarity percentages, and provides a detailed analysis of concordant and discordant pairs.
